<h3>Exiger Challenge</h3>

Hi! Welcome to this repository. It contains the script to get covid data from https://covid-api.com/api/reports API using iso and the date.

Please save an Excel(CSV Format) file with rows date and iso in the desired location and pass the path in file_info.config `input_file`.

`E.g. C:\Users\Documents\exiger\covid-data-puller.csv`

Do note to enter `output_file` as well. It will save a CSV file in the given path.

`E.g. C:\Users\Documents\exiger\covid-data-details.csv`

Once the files are placed, run the main.py to get the desired data.
